A new referal called to ask about a scheduling site where they could accept payment for a block of time. I knew we could host a frontend page on GitHub for free, but I wanted to see what was available for scheduling. Calendly took the lead. Setmore was in the running, but they charge extra for text reminders, ask for bank routing sooner than necessary and the UI is overwhelming compared to the functionality they wanted. Both averaged a cost of forty cents per 10 dollar purchase. And to get the full funtionality either would have charged a monthly subscription. While I'm continuing to research if Square/Setmore might be a better option in the future, I still think Calendly is the best option for what was requested.

Next, we needed to pick a name for the URL.

Freenom offered this free for one year and while they are not in Georgia, '.ga' seemed like a good compromise for the price of free for the first year.

I searched Traversy Media for Responsive Web Designs becaues I knew at least half if not more of the customers would most likely be booking from their phone. I envisioned a full screen image of the studio and once I found a desing I like adding 'fixed' to the CSS kept the background in place as the rest of the site scrolled up over it. This allowed us to keep the rental space as the main focus.

He'd added cards, that seemed like a great option for the different choices that would be offered for booking.

Then I asked for photos.. the more the better. Of both the space to be rented and people using the space as she'd envisioned for the different menu options. Making sure to get permission from her models to place them on the website.

When I asked her to elaborate on what the name meant to her she sent me a symbol that I thought would make a great favicon. I asked for her favorite colors. A blue was already in the desing, but copper and citrine really made it pop and played well off the tones in her models hat and hair.

A few gradients, transparencies, round corners and drop shadows later and I feel like we're getting close to calling it a winner.
